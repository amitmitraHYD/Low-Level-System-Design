# Low-Level-System-Design

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming that focuses on using objects to design and build applications. 
Contrary to procedure-oriented programming where we design our programs as blocks of statements to manipulate data, OOP organizes the program to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an Object.

This whole repo will be based on few examples where we will go through requirement gathering, use case diagrams, class designs, sequence and activity diagrams, as well as the skeleton code implementation.
