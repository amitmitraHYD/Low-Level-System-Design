# Back-of-the-envelope Estimation

## Designing an elevator system and implementing the actual solution will be divided into 3 parts:

1. Discuss how to simulating the elevator design.

2. Identify the classes involved.

3. Implement the elevator design code.
    a. In the first iteration, we will create the classes we identified previously.
    b. In the second iteration, we will add logic to start the elevator and process any jobs if available.
    2. In the third iteration, we will add logic to add jobs to the elevator.
